First, I started with <!DOCTYPE html> to tell the browser I’m using HTML5. 
Then I used <html> to begin the page and added a <head> section. 
In it, I gave the page a title and added a <meta> tag so it works well on phones and desktops. 
Then I used a <style> tag to write the CSS.
I applied <box-sizing: border-box> to keep layout clean. 
The body has no margin, a light gray background, and uses Arial font. 
I created a <container> using Flexbox to center everything. 
Inside it, I made a white box called <.card> with padding, round corners, a shadow, and a max width of 320px. 
I added a <.balance> section to show the money in big green text. 
Then I made a <.btn> class for both buttons with full width, padding, white text, no border, round corners, and a click effect. 
I used <.deposit-btn> for green and <.withdraw-btn> for red. 
Finally, I placed everything inside the container. 
It shows a white card with $0 and two buttons in the center of the screen.
