I created a live character counter that updates automatically as the user types in a textbox. 
The page contains a textarea where the user can enter any text, and just below it, a counter shows the number of characters typed. The layout is styled with a simple border and spacing to make it look neat. Using JavaScript, the counter listens for typing or deleting inside the textarea and instantly updates the number of characters shown. 
This gives users real-time feedback about how much text they have entered.
