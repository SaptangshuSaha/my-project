I created an interactive drawing tool using SVG that allows users to draw freely with their mouse. 
The page contains an SVG area that works like a canvas. When the user clicks and drags inside this area, lines are drawn following the mouse movement, and when the mouse is released, the drawing stops.
 Each new click-and-drag creates a new path, so multiple shapes or strokes can be drawn. 
 This was achieved using JavaScript by handling mouse events like mousedown, mousemove, and mouseup, and by dynamically creating and updating SVG path elements. 
The result is a simple drawing tool where users can write or sketch directly on the web page.
